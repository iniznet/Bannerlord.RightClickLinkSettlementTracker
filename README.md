# Right Click Link Settlement Tracker

> A Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord mod that overrides the default right click menu for settlements to toggle tracker for the settlement instead of opening the settlement encyclopedia page.

# Development

Copy `env.example.xml` to `env.xml` and edit the settings according to your environment. Watch out for the ampersand in XML files.

The `PostBuild.ps1` script will auto execute on successful builds, and assemble the final distributable folder of the module inside the `.\dist` directory.
